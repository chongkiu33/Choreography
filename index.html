                1.Characterless<br>
                The dancer are all ordinary people dress in ordinary clothes. Three men and four women dressed in casual clothes typical of late 1960 Americans: shirts, t-shirts, jeans / loose trousers and sneakers. One ’magic-man’ wearing a top hat.

                2.Disoriented<br>
                In the Trio A, the choreography look like a disoriented body. 
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                3.Disharmony<br>
                The body language is in between harmony and disharmony. There is a set of movements where the body is constantly shaking and the arms are swinging back and forth. There are movements that look like an imitation of a machine. The dance always continues in an unexpected way.
            </div>

            <div class="block">
                4.Discrete movement:<br>
                Trio A consists of a four-and-a-half-to-five-minute sequence of discrete movements that with the exception of walking.

            <div class="block">
                5.Experimental<br>
                Trio A was initially performed in 1966 by Rainer and fellow New York choreographer-dancers under the title The Mind is a muscle at Manhattan’s Judson Memorial Church. After that. It has been presented in various forms. Sometimes integrated into other pieces by Rainer or adapted by other choreographers.

            <div class="block">
                6.Lack of interaction<br>
                Performer never makes eye contact with spectators, and in the instance in which the movement requires the dancer to face the audience, the eyes are closed or the head is involved in movement. This create the effect of a blank gaze in to the mid-ground.

                8.Minimalist
                Rainer transposed to dance the ideas that were then giving shape to the era’s minimalist sculpture and painting, abandoning the aesthetic of classical and moderndance.

                Although Rainer used repetition in earlier works as a device to make movement easier to read, she decided to not repeat movement in Trio A.

            Even though Rainer play with sound in her early work, there is no sound and rhythm in Trio A.
            She remove the syncopation in the choreography in order to make it no dramatic.

            <div class="block">
                12.Task-oriented<br>
                Rainer execute movements with an even distribution of energy reflected a challenge to traditional attitudes to “phrasing”, which can be defined as the way in which energy investment within both a given phrase and the transition from one to another.

                Rainer was trained in a style of movement characterized by expressiveness and virtuosity and in narrative choreography filled with drama and psychological intensity. He began to dissatisfied with the conventions of modern dance and the traditional relationship between dancer and audience. “Early on, I began to question the pleasure I took in being looked at, this dual voyeuristic, exhibitionistic relation of dancer to audience”Fueled by such questioning, and her opposition to the tenets of classical and modern dance, she created Trio A.

                1.Work<br>
                My project and The Mind is a Muscle both talk about body performance at work. Rainer introduce many work-like performances into her choreography in order to propose a new form of non stylish dance.
                This inspire me to use dance as way to propose a new form of work. Can we consider working as entertainment/leisure when we are dancing?

                The way Rainer directed movement proposed that choreography might be a kind of readymade aesthetic to be ‘found’ in city street, which encourage me to find choreography in working environment.

                In work of Rainer, presentation of the body-as-object or object-as-body tested a continuum between inertia a movement or between the individual and the industrial, often with humor.
                In my project, I next want to use my body to explore the boundaries between productivity and laziness, work and leisure with a sense of humor.
